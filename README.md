# 📘 CSES Problem Set — My Progressive Journey

Welcome to the **cses-problem-set** repository!  
This is my personal journey to **solve the entire CSES Problem Set**, one problem at a time. I'm uploading solutions as I go, organized neatly by topic.

The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a well-curated collection of competitive programming problems that cover all the essential algorithms and data structures — perfect for building a strong foundation.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each topic from the CSES Problem Set is placed in its own directory. Example:

   ```text
   cses-problem-set/
   ├── Introductory Problems/
   │   ├── weird_algorithm.cpp
   │   ├── missing_number.cpp
   │   └── ...
   ├── Sorting and Searching/
   │   ├── ferris_wheel.cpp
   │   └── ...
   └── Graph Algorithms/
       ├── counting_rooms.cpp
       └── ...
```

- Filenames are based on the problem titles from CSES.
- Solutions are primarily in **C++** with proper formatting and comments.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

- To improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- To prepare for coding interviews and contests
- To maintain a clean, organized log of my DSA practice
- To help others who might be following a similar path

## 📌 How to Use

- Browse the folders to find solutions to individual problems
- Refer to the code for logic, comments, and structure
- Clone the repo if you want to fork and track your own progress:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sambodhi-Roy/cses-problem-set.git
